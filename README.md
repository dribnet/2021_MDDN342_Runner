## 2020 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Face Mappings

My inital idea for my face is a stylised face with watercolour-esque shading on one side.

Created the face base and most of the watercolour shading areas in red.
Two of the sliders are currently in control of the thickness of the top eyelid and the colour of the eyes.
