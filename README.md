## 2020 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Face Mappings

My inital idea for my face is a stylised face with watercolour-esque shading on one side.

Created the face base and all of the watercolour shaded sections and gave an outline to those for a fringe effect.
Five of the sliders are currently in control of:
  the thickness of the top eyelid
  the colour of the eyes
  style of the lip
  how bright the face is
  hue of the entire face
