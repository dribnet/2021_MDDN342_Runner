## 2020 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Face Mappings

My inital idea for my face is a stylised face with watercolour-esque shading on one side.

Created the face base and all of the watercolour shaded sections and gave an outline to those for a fringe effect

Five of the sliders are currently in control of:
  the thickness of the top eyelid
  the colour of the eyes
  style of the lip
  how bright the face is
  hue of the entire face

In the training, the parameters were picked based on these:
  The hue of the face is determined by the shade of the hair.
    Bluer hue - darker hair colour
    Reder hue - lighter hair colour
  Masculine faces have thinner eye outlines and feminine faces have filled in lips.
  The eye lightness corresponded to the lightness of the eyes in the images.
  The shade depended on the skin tone of the images.
