## 2020 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Face Mappings

The idea for my assignment is a stylised face with watercolour-esque shading on one side. The watercolour-esque effect is created through cascading shaded areas to create something similar to a gradient. An outline is added to these to imitate how watercolour can dry and create a fringe effect.

Five of the sliders are in control of:
  the thickness of the top eyelid
  the colour of the eyes
  style of the lip
  how bright the face is
  hue of the entire face

In the training, the parameters were picked based on these:
  The hue of the face is determined by the shade of the hair.
    Bluer hue - darker hair colour
    Reder hue - lighter hair colour
  Masculine faces have thinner eye outlines and feminine faces have filled in lips.
  The eye lightness corresponded to the lightness of the eyes in the images.
  The shade depended on the skin tone of the images.
